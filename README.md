# What exactly are we doing? <a id="objective"></a> 
We are building communities by connecting people together for common objectives. By enabling event organizers to advertise volunteering roles, people can easily learn about new opportunities and cool events that they can help out with. 

Our web app, allows people to find events in their interest from academic to social events in their local area! Volunteering opportunities just within their reach. Users can also learn about organizations and programs that they might want to get further involved in too. 

# How does it work? <a id="how"></a>
We personalize the dashboard to present events that are within the user's interest. By keeping their accounts anonymous, they can comfortably browse opportunities and reach out to organizers or volunteers. We will alert the user through their email about any relevent events that are in their area that they might be interested in getting involved in.
